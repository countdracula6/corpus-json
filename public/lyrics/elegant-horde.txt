Verse 1

They dance in ash, they chant for war
In fields where meaning meant much more
They drink to death with painted face
And claim it’s “truth” — oh, such disgrace

Chorus

An elegant horde,
Where the lonely bleat and roar
You mistook silence for might,
But it’s eyeliner in the night

Verse 2

They burned the church to feel alive
But even goats have dreams to strive
You scream for gods that never cared
I write sad songs — completely bared

Bridge

Your frostbitten corpse is a fashion show
I knew a boy just like you, long ago
He wore chains like medals, how absurd
But cried when I called him a four-letter word

Chorus

An elegant horde,
Carving thrones out of discord
But behind the smoke and ice,
You just wanted to be nice

Outro

So wave your sword, pretend you feel
But we both know what’s truly real—
A well-cut suit, a spiteful grin
And the art of never letting them in...
