"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThey dance in ash, they chant for war\nIn fields where meaning meant much more\nThey drink to death with painted face\nAnd claim it’s “truth” — oh, such disgrace\n\n[Chorus]\nAn elegant horde,\nWhere the lonely bleat and roar\nYou mistook silence for might,\nBut it’s eyeliner in the night\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey burned the church to feel alive\nBut even goats have dreams to strive\nYou scream for gods that never cared\nI write sad songs — completely bared\n\n[Bridge]\nYour frostbitten corpse is a fashion show\nI knew a boy just like you, long ago\nHe wore chains like medals, how absurd\nBut cried when I called him a four-letter word\n\n[Chorus]\nAn elegant horde,\nCarving thrones out of discord\nBut behind the smoke and ice,\nYou just wanted to be nice\n\n[Outro]\nSo wave your sword, pretend you feel\nBut we both know what’s truly real—\nA well-cut suit, a spiteful grin\nAnd the art of never letting them in..."
